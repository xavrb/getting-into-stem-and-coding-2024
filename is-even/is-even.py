# This is a program that acts as a function to decide whether a number is even or odd.
# It outputs (prints) "is even" if the number is even and "is odd" otherwise.
# This program is incomplete -- your goal in this session is to deliver fully functional code to decide 
#   wether or not a number is odd.
# Modify this file accordingly and push it to the repo.




num = 10                     # num is a variable that has a value of 10

if num % 2 == 0:             # % is the operator for the modulus operation
    print(num, "is even")
