# This is a program that acts as a calculator, it has 2 inputs: a and b. 
# It outputs (prints) the four basic operations results if a an b are the inputs.
# This program is incomplete -- your goal in this session is to deliver a fully functional calculator.
# Modify this file accordingly and push it to the repo.


a = 5  # a is a variable that has a value of 5
b = 3  # b is a variable that has a value of 3

sum_result = a + b        # sum_result is a variable that stores the result of doing a + b.
difference_result = a - b # difference_result is a variable that stores the result of doing a - b.


# print() is a function that will "show" whatever you tell it.

print("Sum:", sum_result)                   # In this case we are "telling" print() to show the string "Sum:" and the result.
print("Difference:", difference_result)     # In this case we are "telling" print() to show the string "Difference:" and the result.
